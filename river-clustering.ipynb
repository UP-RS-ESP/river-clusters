    "This is a tutorial on how to perform agglomerative hierarchical clustering on river profiles, using an example from the Pozo catchment, Santa Cruz Island.  We can use this to classify the landscape into different domains, which can be used to explore erosion rates, lithology, or the influence of climate and tectonics on landscapes.  You can find more details of the method in this paper:\n",
